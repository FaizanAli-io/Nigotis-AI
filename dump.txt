### Analysis of Inactive Clients

1. **Duration of Inactivity**:
   - The clients have been inactive for a substantial period, ranging from 97 to 125 days, indicating a potential decline in engagement.
   - This duration suggests that a re-engagement strategy is necessary, as clients who have been inactive for over 90 days may require more targeted efforts to regain their interest.

2. **Product Overlap**:
   - All three clients have purchased Mobile App Development services, indicating a strong interest in this area.
   - There is a mix of services related to IT and digital solutions, suggesting these clients may have ongoing needs that have not been met or updated.

3. **Diversity in Services**:
   - The clients have used a variety of services, from IT support to digital marketing and analytics, which indicates they may value comprehensive digital solutions.
   - This diversity presents an opportunity to cross-sell additional services that complement their previous purchases.

### Actionable Insights for Re-engagement

1. **Personalized Outreach Strategies**:
   - **Email Campaigns**: Send personalized emails to each client acknowledging their inactivity and expressing a desire to understand their current needs. Include a brief survey to gather feedback on why they haven’t engaged recently and what services they are currently interested in.
   - **Follow-up Calls**: Assign account managers to reach out via phone to discuss their past experiences and potential new projects. This personal touch can help rebuild relationships and trust.

2. **Promotions and Incentives**:
   - **Special Discounts**: Offer a limited-time discount on services they have previously purchased or related services. For example, a 20% discount on their next Mobile App Development project could entice Mr. Ali Shaikh and Mr. Ali Shah.
   - **Loyalty Program**: Introduce a loyalty program that rewards clients for returning, such as earning points for each purchase that can be redeemed for future services or exclusive offers.

3. **Product Suggestions**:
   - **Tailored Service Packages**: Create tailored packages that include their past purchases along with complementary services. For instance, for Ms. Sobia Malik, propose a package that includes an updated Mobile App Development project with ongoing IT Support Services.
   - **Educative Content**: Provide insights or whitepapers on trends in their industry related to their past purchases (e.g., advancements in Cloud Hosting or benefits of updated Digital Marketing strategies). This content can position your company as a thought leader and rekindle their interest.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - **Post-Engagement Surveys**: After re-engagement efforts, follow up with surveys to evaluate their satisfaction and gather insights into their evolving needs. This will help the company adapt strategies and offerings to better fit the market.

5. **Re-engagement Campaigns**:
   - **Webinars/Workshops**: Host webinars or workshops that focus on industry trends and how your services can assist in overcoming common challenges, targeting the specific interests of these clients.

By implementing these strategies, the company can effectively re-engage inactive clients and potentially convert them back into active, loyal customers.
